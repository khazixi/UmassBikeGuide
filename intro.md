# UMass Bike Guide

## Purpose

I think bikes can be a particularly fun to ride. Moreover, I think they are a powerful way to
get around in Western Massachusetts. I aim at making an all purpose guide onto what your bike
is capable of doing throughout the area.

## Index

I Plan to divide this series up into 3 chapters

[1. Bikes within the campus](1.md)

[2. Near campus exploration](2.md)

[3. Far Land Cycling](3.md)
