# Near Campus Exploration

## Off Campus Housing

While getting around within the Campus is a wonderful
usage for bikes, another thing that they allow is for
reasonable transportation times for off campus housing
near the University. 

The farthest off campus housing (within Amherst) is only a 24 minute bike ride!

## Downtown

Getting downtown is really fast on Bicycle. Assuming you
start from Worcester, it only takes 10 minutes on bike to
get to Downtown. In 3-5 more minutes you would be at Amherst
College (which you can take a class at via the 5 College Consortium partnership).

There are a wide variety of things downtown for you to explore, 
and you get to explore them on your own time with a bike!

## Puffer's Pond and North Amherst

Puffer's Pond is the local fishing spot in Amherst, and while it is best to get there
via bus or car, especially if you are carrying a lot of gear, it is around 12 minutes 
from Worcester, so you are not very far from the Campus.

There is also a cute little spot in the North of Amherst between 
116 and 63. If there are things open I'd advise you to take a look.

## Norwottuck Rail Trail

This is by far one of the most useful trails you have at your disposal. 
I like to think of it as Bike Highway that takes you to a bunch of 
useful places.

### Hadley and The Hampshire Mall

One of the most useful places that the trail can take you to is the mall.
While there is also a more direct route which has a bike lane along 116
which is slightly shorter, I find the Norwuttuck Trail to be by far the 
comfiest way to get to the mall. 

From Worcester it takes around 25 minutes to get to the mall via the Norwottuck Rail Trail.

From Worcester it takes around 21 minutes to get to the all via Route 116.

The trail also leads you off close to Central Rock Gym in 34 minutes.

### Northampton

The other useful place that the trail takes you is Northampton. 
Northampton itself is a town with a lot of things going on.

Here I will list all the things Northampton has:
    - Smith College
    - Academy of Music
    - Wider Variety of Restaraunts
    - A comprehensive bus network which extends to a large section of the pioneer valley:
        - Bus which takes you directly to Springfield (All days of the week)
        - Bus which takes you directly to the Holyoke Mall
        - Bus which takes you to UMass and Hampshire Mall
        - Bus which takes you to Greenfield (Not in the PVTA Network)
    - The Vermonter Amtrak which takes you into New York City
    - Another Bike Trail which takes you to Southampton, Easthampton, and Holyoke

### Belchertown

The Trail also takes you to Belchertown, however, I find this section of the trail
to be less useful than the Northampton/Hadley half. Especially because Route 9 is
a more direct route to whatever housing you need to get to in Amherst. Moreover,
the trail ends 20 minutes away from the Belchertown's downtown.

## Sunderland

Sunderland has a bike lane and bus system which can take you to Worcester in a time
ranging from 17-35 minutes depending on how deep you are located.

In the [next chapter](3.md) we will talk about longer rides within Western Massachusetts and some of the trails you have available to yolonger rides within Western Massachusetts and some of the trails you have available to you.
