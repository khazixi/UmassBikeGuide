# Bikes within the Campus 

## Why Own a bike

Bikes can be particilarly useful tools on Campus.
Bikes can shorten a great amount of the time spent
walking to places. For instance, if I wanted to get
from Webster Hall to Kennedy Hall, the walk may be
up to 20 minutes, however, the bike ride is around
5 minutes (A huge reduction). Generally, you can 
expect a bike to be around 3-4 times as fast as
walking when planning to go from anywhere on Campus.

## Electric Scooters

Electric Scooters can also be a great option for 
short distance rides. The Added benefit of Electric
Scooters is you don't need to put any physical effort
into getting the scooter moving, just charge it and go.
This can be particularly nice when traversing up to 
Orchard Hill or Sylvan. Moreover, Scooters have the
added benefit that they are easier to fit inside of
cars.

## Notable Paths

### Orchard Hill and High Central

There are multiple ways to get up Orchard Hill such as:
- The pathway
- The Walkway along Thatcher Road
- Chancellor's Drive
- Walkway next to the New Africa House
- Clark Hill Road

The easiest to get up in my opinion are:
- Chancellor's Drive
- The Pathway Along Sylvan

These are generally the least steep ways to get up.
They also have the added benefit that they are relatively
unbusy.

Another option can be taking Bus 35 or Bus 34 to 
Orchard Hill as you can mount your bike to the 
front of the bus, and take your scooter inside of 
the bus.

### Southwest

The most optimal way to get to and from Southwest is usually going through the tunnel.

If you are in Southwest, you should also consider going by Commonwealth Avenue for classes 
that are close to that area. The added advantage of going through Commonwelath Ave is that
you can often go quite fast as there are not that many people going through the dining hall.

## Storage and Parking

### Residential Building Storage

Every Residential Hall has outdoor storage for Bikes and Electric Scooters.

However, I'd advise against leaving your bike outside during winter breaks,
as the weather conditions can cause the chains on your bike to rust, reducing
your bikes overall speed. If possible, I suggest keeping it indoors at either
the UMass Bike Coop, Indoor Storage in Honors College (or whichever dorm you are in),
or keeping it inside of your room.

### Parking for Academic Buildings

Most Academic buildings come equipped with bike racks near the buildings themselves,
meaning once you get to a location, the walk to the building itself is never more 
than a building.

In the [next chapter](2.md) we will talk about off campus areas that your bike can bring you too.
