# Bikes within the Campus 

## Why Own a bike

Bikes can be particilarly useful tools on Campus.
Bikes can shorten a great amount of the time spent
walking to places. For instance, if I wanted to get
from Webster Hall to Kennedy Hall, the walk may be
up to 20 minutes, however, the bike ride is around
5 minutes (A huge reduction). Generally, you can 
expect a bike to be around 3-4 times as fast as
walking when planning to go from anywhere on Campus.

## Electric Scooters

Electric Scooters can also be a great option for 
short distance rides. The Added benefit of Electric
Scooters is you don't need to put any physical effort
into getting the scooter moving, just charge it and go.
This can be particularly nice when traversing up to 
Orchard Hill or Sylvan. Moreover, Scooters have the
added benefit that they are easier to fit inside of
cars.
